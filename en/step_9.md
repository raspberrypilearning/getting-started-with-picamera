## What next?

Now you know how to use your Camera Module, you could:

* Add buttons to control the camera with the help of [GPIO Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.org/) Python code


Try these Camera Module projects to learn more:

- Create a [push button stop-motion](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/push-button-stop-motion/) film
- Build a [parent detector](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/parent-detector/)
- Use the NoIR Camera Module to create an [infrared bird box](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/infrared-bird-box/)

For more information on how to use the `picamzero` library, check out `picamzero`'s [official documentation](https://raspberrypifoundation.github.io/picamera-zero).
