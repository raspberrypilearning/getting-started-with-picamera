## What next?

Now you've got started with the Camera Module, you could try adding GPIO controls using [GPIO Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.org/), integrate with Minecraft Pi, or even post your pictures to Twitter! 

Try some more camera resources:

- [Push button stop-motion](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/push-button-stop-motion/)
- [Minecraft photobooth](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/minecraft-photobooth/)
- [Tweeting Babbage](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/tweeting-babbage/)
- [Parent detector](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/parent-detector/)
- Use the NoIR cameras to create an [Infrared bird box](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/infrared-bird-box/)

Also, see the extensive [picamera documentation](https://picamera.readthedocs.org/) for more information.
