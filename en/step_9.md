## What next?

Now you know how to use your Camera Module, you could for example:
* Add buttons to control the camera with the help of [GPIO Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.org/) Python code
* Integrate the camera with Minecraft Pi

Try these Camera Module projects to learn more:

- Create a [push button stop-motion](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/push-button-stop-motion/) film
- Make a [Minecraft photobooth](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/minecraft-photobooth/)
- Build a [parent detector](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/parent-detector/)
- Use the NoIR Camera Module to create an [infrared bird box](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/infrared-bird-box/)

For more information about writing Python code to control the Camera Module, see the extensive [documentation](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/camera/picamera2-manual.pdf).
