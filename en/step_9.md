## What next?

Now you've got started with the Camera Module, you could try adding GPIO controls using [GPIO Zero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.org/), integrate with Minecraft Pi, or even post your pictures to Twitter! Try some more camera resources:

- [Push button stop-motion](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/push-button-stop-motion/)
- [Minecraft photobooth](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/minecraft-photobooth/)
- [Tweeting Babbage](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-python-tweeting-babbage)
- [Parent detector](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-python-parent-detector/)

There's also an infrared version of the camera (called Pi NoIR) which gives you everything the regular Camera Module offers, with one difference: it doesn't use an infrared filter. This gives you the ability to see in the dark with infrared lighting. See the [Infrared bird box](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/infrared-bird-box/) resource for making the most of the Pi NoIR camera.

Also, see the extensive [picamera documentation](https://picamera.readthedocs.org/) for more information.
