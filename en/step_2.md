**Note -** if you are using a Raspberry Pi Zero you will need an additional Pi Zero camera module cable as the zero has a smaller camera connector.

### Raspberry Pi Camera Module

    - [standard](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) which is designed to tak pictures in normal light.
