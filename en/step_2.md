All current models of Raspberry Pi have a port for connecting the Camera Module.

**Note:** If you want to use a Raspberry Pi Zero, you need a Camera Module ribbon cable that fits the Raspberry Pi Zero's smaller Camera Module port.

### Raspberry Pi Camera Module

There are two versions of the Camera Module:

* [The standard version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/), which is designed to take pictures in normal light
* [The NoIR version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/), which doesn't have an infrared filter, so you can use it together with an infrared light source to take pictures in the dark
