## Introduction

This guide is written for systems running either Raspberry Pi OS or Raspberry Pi OS Lite, using a Bullseye or later image. 

To use this guide, you will need to [install](https://raspberrypifoundation.github.io/picamera-zero/install) `picamzero` - a library designed to make using the camera on the Raspberry Pi as easy as possible.

Learn how to connect the Raspberry Pi Camera Module to your Raspberry Pi and take pictures, record video, and apply image effects.
